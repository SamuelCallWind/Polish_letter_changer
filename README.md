# Polish_letter_changer
Small program that will erase the Polish letter that has issues in the file and set them back to how they should be

## what does the program do ? 
When downloading some Polish subtitles text files for your favorite movies (as you should because it's a beautiful language !), it might happen that some characters are not encoded correctly
Here are the Polish letters that create the problems : ćśżźółń and of course their uppercase ŻŹĆŚŁÓŃ.

So this program let you upload your file to the page, create a link for it and let you download the file back with all the letters correctly displayed.
